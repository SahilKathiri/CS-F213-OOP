Tutorial held on 10<sup>th</sup> September 2015, Thursday.

* Write a program which reads a no from the keyboard and check if its divisible by 5 and 6. (All possible combinations should be handled.)
* Write a complete Java program that generates the first ‘n’ Fibonacci numbers, where ‘n’ is read as user input. <br>
  Input:  `Enter n: 6`  
  Output: `1 1 2 3 5 11`
* Write a complete Java program that reads an integer no from the user that computes the sum and prints the value.<br>
  Input:   `12345`   
  Output = `15`
* Write a program that reads 3 edges of a triangle and determines if it’s a valid triangle or not. Also classify them as Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene triangle.
* Write a complete Java program to compute the func(x)  using the formula Both x (of type float) and m (of type int) are read as input from the keyboard, the result is to be displayed on the screen.
* Write a program to read a list of integers from command line and print the no of positive, negative and zeros in the list.<br>
  Compilation:  `countProg  10 20 -3 4 0 0 -2 `     
  Output :      `positive nos = 3, negative nos =  2, zeros = 2`
* Write a complete Java program that read a series of numbers entered on the command line and displays the maximum, minimum and average of the nos. <br>
  Compilation:  `MaxMinSum 1 4 0 -1 3`    
  Output:       `Max = 4, Min = -1, Avg = 1.4`
